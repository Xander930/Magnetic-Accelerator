This is a batch of programs designed to be run on Arudino.
The programs are for an ongoing project, with the end goal of constructing an advanced coil-based accelerator.

The programs will begin simple, as the design starts out rather basic, and get more and more complex.
Note that the code is mostly for the trigger and timing mechanisms, and is written in C++.

They're organized into folders according to the design they correlate to, and each folder contains both a readme and several subfolders for organisation of code into categories, according to function.

NOTE: THIS IS NTO FOR MILITARY OR LETHAL USE. It is purely for scientific purposes, and just because.
